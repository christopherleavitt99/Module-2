# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
The dataset I decided to analyze was Pokemon with stats. Looking at the csv file in Excel, it lists their number, name, types, total stats, HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Generation, and legendary status.

My purpose in creating this software is to learn more about Python using Pokemon, their stats, and rankings in their world.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

Who is the most powerful Pokemon? It is tie between all versions of Mewtwo and all versions of Rayquaza at 780 stats.

How many Pokemon have a legendary status? 65

# Development Environment

I used Python in IDLE Shell 3.11.3.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I wasn't able to figure out how to put the Python in a software in VS Code per se. Hopefully my video was informative enough.
